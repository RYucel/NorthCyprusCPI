# North Cyprus CPI and Forecast
One of the applications of artificial intelligence is to create interactive web apps that can display and analyze data. In this project, I used streamlit, a Python library that allows rapid prototyping of web apps, to create an app that shows the consumer price index (CPI) data of North Cyprus from 1988 to the present, and then forecasts it for the next 12 months with a confidence interval. 
The only part that was not generated by AI was the forecasting model, which I used a simple linear regression for. The whole project took me less than 10 minutes to complete.
